# ISI
My scripts that I wrote and used at Czech Academy of Sciences, Institute of Scientific Instruments (CAS ISI). 

In this dictionary contains simple tools for expeperiment control:
  - Signal generation (sine wave) 
  - Collection of signal from quadrant detector
  - Simple Basler camera controler
  - Multiple main funcitons for different purposes that connect tools above for the usecase I needed
  - .zip file containing virtual enviroment that I used with all the scripts

Hopefully in the future the code will have better documentation comments but right now I am overwhelmed by other tasks.
