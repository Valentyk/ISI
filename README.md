# ISI
My scripts that I wrote and used at Czech Academy of Sciences, Institute of Scientific Instruments (CAS ISI). 

In this dictionary I have simple tools for expeperiment control:
-Signal generation (sine wave) 
-Collection of signal from quadrant detector
-Simple Basler camera controler
-Multiple main funcitons for different purposes that connect tools above for the usecase I needed
